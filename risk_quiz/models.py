This app is based on the source code provided by Dr. Zhang Jingjing.
The source code seems originally developped by Chengbin Feng (UNSW)

1. We have three questions, let me firstly get one question;
(using my old method will need to define lots of variables
try to understand Feng's method, or define the var in var_in_templates)

2. Then create three questions in a fixed order;
    28/07 pushed the app to heroku, however, the pop out windows (modal) is not
    working try to figure out why.

3. Then follow here https://www.otreehub.com/projects/otree-snippets/ to
randomize the round/page/task order.

4. randomly choose one to pay (for each question choice one?)
