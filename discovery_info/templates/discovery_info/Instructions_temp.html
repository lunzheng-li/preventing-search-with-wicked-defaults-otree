        <p>Welcome and thank you for participating in today&rsquo;s experiment. Please turn off your phone now and put it away. Please do not talk during the experiment. <b>If you have a question, please type it in the Zoom chatbox and send it only to the experimenter who will answer it.</b></p>
        <p>Your earnings in this experiment will depend on your own choices and on chance moves. Understanding the instructions is likely to increase your earnings. Earnings are private. You will receive a&nbsp;${{participation_fee}}.00 participation fee. You will be asked to submit your PayID at the end of the experiment to receive the online transfer of your earnings.</p>
        <p><strong>The Choice Tasks and Payoffs:</strong>&nbsp;There are<strong> {{num_rounds}} decision rounds&nbsp;</strong>in this experiment.</p>
        <p>In each round, you will collect points depending on your choice and on chance. At the end of the experiment, <u>{{num_rounds_to_pay}} of the {{num_rounds}} rounds</u> will be chosen randomly and the points &nbsp;you earn in those rounds will be paid out to you with an exchange rate of $1&nbsp;for every&nbsp;{{point_to_dollar_factor}} points.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Endowment</u></strong></p>
        <p>At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of {{endowment}} points.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Offers</u></strong></p>
        <p>For each round, the values for <strong>{{num_cards}}</strong> offer cards were randomly generated by the computer.</p>
        <p>All values are integers between and including {{offers_bottom}} and {{offers_top}}. Each of these values is equally likely, and independent of others. These values differ from round to round.</p>
        <p>One of the offer cards is always chosen as the initial offer. The {{num_cards_minus_1}} remaining cards are reshuffled and placed in a random order every round. The initial offer card is always shown on the top.</p>
        <p>If you like the initial offer, you can accept it immediately.</p>
        <p>If you do not like the initial offer, you can reveal further offers.</p>
        
        <p><strong><u>How the initial offer is determined</u></strong></p>
        <p>
            In 50% of rounds, selected randomly, the initial offer is random just like the remaining 9 (hidden) offers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the other 50% of rounds, the initial offer is carefully chosen from among the 10 random offers by a profit-maximizing seller.  The seller's profit is negatively related to the value of the offer that you eventually accept.   The seller has selected the lowest offer that it believes you will accept without searching.  
        </p>
        
        <p><strong><u>Cost of revealing other offers </u></strong></p>
        <p>Revealing additional offers incurs a fixed cost of {{cost_of_offer}} points per offer.</p>
        <p><strong>So your COST in a round equals (number of offers you reveal) x {{cost_of_offer}} points.</strong></p>
        <p><strong><u>Accepting an offer and termination of a round</u></strong></p>
        <p>You can always accept the best offer revealed so far. Accepting an offer terminates the round.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Your Payoffs</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Your payoff in a round equals:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>{{endowment}} + BEST OFFER at the moment you accept - YOUR COST in that round</strong></p>
        <p>In this experiment you will get information about the best offer so far, about the cost of the offers you revealed so far, and about what your payoff would be if you accepted at that moment. Here is an example:</p>

        {% if cost_of_offer == 5 %}

                    <strong><u>Note:</u>   
                        Cost of offers if you accept the best offer = number of paid offers(2) x 5 points = 10 points <br>
                        Payoff if you accept the best offer = 200 + best offer so far(98) - cost of offers(10) = 288 points</strong>

                        Payoff if you accept the best offer = 200 + best offer so far(98) - cost of offers(60) = 238 points</strong>
